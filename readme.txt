Shrink, track and share any URL on the Internet from your WordPress website. Create short links suitable for Twitter using your own domain name!

== Description ==

Shrink, track and share any URL on the Internet from your WordPress website. You can now shorten links using your own domain name (as opposed to using tinyurl.com, bit.ly, or any other link shrinking service)! In addition to creating clean links, Pretty Link tracks each hit on your URL and provides a full, detailed report of where the hit came from, the browser, os and host. Pretty Link is a killer plugin for people who want to mask their affiliate links, track clicks from emails, their links on Twitter to come from their own domain, or generally increase the reach of their website by spreading these links on forums or comments on other blogs.

= Examples =

Here's a named Pretty Link (I used the slug 'aweber') that redirects to aweber.com:

Here's a link that Pretty Link generated a random slug for (similar to how bit.ly or tinyurl would do):

== Installation ==

1. Upload 'pretty-link.zip' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

3. Make sure you have changed your permalink Common Settings in Settings -> Permalinks away from "Default" to something else. I prefer using custom and then "/%postname%/" for the simplest possible URL slugs.
