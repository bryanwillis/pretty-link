With Pretty Link you can create shortened, named URLs using your website's domain name.

== Description ==

With Pretty Link you can create shortened, named URLs using your website's domain name. This plugin makes the cleanest links possible because they are on your site instead of from tinyurl, budurl or one of the other link shrinking services. You can also track stats on your links easily and keep that data on your own database.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Make sure you have changed your permalink Common Settings in Settings -> Permalinks away from "Default" to something else. I prefer using custom and then "/%postname%/" for the simplest possible tags.
