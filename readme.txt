Create clean, simple links on your website that link to other URLs using Pretty Link. For instance, this URL: http://www.yourdomain.com/cnn could link to http://www.cnn.com -- this is EXTREMELY useful for masking Affiliate Links. Pretty Link is a superior alternative to using TinyURL, BudURL or other link shrinking service because the URLs are coming from your website's domain name. When these links are used, pretty link not only redirects but also keeps track of the click count.

== Description ==

Create clean, simple links on your website that link to other URLs using Pretty Link.

= Features =

* Gives you the ability to create clean, simple URLs on your website that redirect to any other URL
* Generates random 2-3 character slugs for your URL or allows you to name a custom slug for your URL
* Tracks the Number of Clicks per link

== Installation ==

1. Upload 'pretty-link.zip' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

3. Make sure you have changed your permalink Common Settings in Settings -> Permalinks away from "Default" to something else. I prefer using custom and then "/%postname%/" for the simplest possible URL slugs.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

* This plugin is extremely simple. All you have to do is to find the pretty link admin menu (bottom left of your admin page) and start by clicking "Add a Pretty Link."

= NOTE: =

You must have pretty permalinks and rewrite working in your Wordpress/PHP/Apache install before pretty links will work (this is already done in most cases but if you can't get anything but Default permalinks working then you may need to contact your system administrator). Pretty links utlilzes Wordpress's URL rewriting capabilities (via Apache's mod_rewrite) which are only turned on when you change the settings in "Settings -> Permalinks" from "Default" to something else. If you want your blog to have any kind of decent SEO then you really should do this anyway.
